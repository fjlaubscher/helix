## What is Helix?

`Helix` is an opinionated `React` boilerplate which tries to keep config to a minimum while allowing you to configure what you need.

## What does it do?

- ‚öôÔ∏è Minimal and accessible config
- ‚ôªÔ∏è HMR (Hot Module Replacement) with Webpack 4
- ü§∏‚Äç Code Splitting with `React.lazy`
- üìö CSS Modules
- üì± PWA ready
- üèé Pre-render HTML using `react-snap`

## Why Helix and not create-react-app?

`create-react-app` suits most, if not all, needs when it comes to bootstrapping `React` apps and has a massive community supporting it.<br />
`Helix` is something a lot more
niche, allowing power-users to tweak anything to their needs while
providing a simple and clean foundation.

Don&apos;t like CSS modules and want something else?
<br />
<strong>You can change it.</strong>

# Getting Started
## Config
Copy the sample `.env` file and create a `.env` of your own.
```
cp sample.env .env
```
### What do these ENV variables do?
None of these variables are required.<br />
If you don't want any of these features, simply exclude them from your `.env` file.<br />
- `PORT` allows you to run the webpack dev server on a specific port. If unset, the default port is 3000.
- `PUBLIC_URL` allows you to bundle the app if you're hosting it on a subroute.<br />Something like `https://yourwebsite.com/helix/` is a perfect case here. (Important to always leave a trailing slash when setting this variable)
- `NODE_ENV` enables the Service Worker and allows you to skip installing devDependencies.
- `VERSION` allows you to visit `/health` in your React app to view the current version number.


## npm
```
npm install
